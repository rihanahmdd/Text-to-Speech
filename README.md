# Text-to-Speech
A Simple GUI Python Program what converts text into speeches. It is the first GUI Program what I made. You can use this program to convert texts into speechs. I better know I should have done this in any other Programming Language what are far better than Python for GUIs. Reason to program GUIs in Python is just to build logical power. You can use this program, you can modify this, but you can't launch this as a softwear. Please use my name wherever you use this program. And don't forget to give your valuable feedback.

Thank You
